# RelationDistributionTester

This program is a simple viewer for you to see how the data is splitted into train/test/development/validation data set. The input file format looks like:

29
1
34
95

...

These numbers are the classes label index.

Just import the project into Eclipse, edit the data file path, and run CollectRelation, you will see the whole data distribution on the console.
